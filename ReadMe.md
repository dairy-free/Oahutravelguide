This site was created using raw HTML, Javascript, and SCSS. It was designed with mobile first in mind.

Navbar displays hamburger menu on mobile and a full navigation bar when the media query is hit for desktop.

This site also has a carousel that was made with vanilla JS. Images are tracked via 'dots' that display the amount of images as well as what place you are in. When you are on the first image the left arrow will not be displayed and when on the last image the right arrow will not be displayed. The dots are clickable and will skip to the clicked destination. 

The last notable feature is the minuture weather app that gathers data from openweathermap api.
fetch is used to retrieve data for temperature value(converted to F), weather description, City(Honululu), correct icon, and the country.
Once the data is retrieved a function is called that displays the current weather conditions for Honululu
